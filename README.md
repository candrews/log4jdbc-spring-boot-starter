Log4jdbc Spring Boot Starter
============================

[![DevOps By Rultor.com](http://www.rultor.com/b/andrey-vasilyev/spring-boot-starter-log4jdbc)](http://www.rultor.com/b/andrey-vasilyev/spring-boot-starter-log4jdbc)


The Log4jdbc Spring Boot 3 Starter facilitates the quick and easy use of [log4jdbc](http://log4jdbc.brunorozendo.com/) in Spring Boot projects.

Log4jdbc is particularly handy as it can log SQL that is ready to run. 
Instead of logging SQL with '?' where parameter values need to be inserted (like, for example, 
what `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true` does), log4jdbc can log SQL with those placeholders substituted 
with their actual values. So instead of `select name from User where id = ?` the log will say `select name from User where id = 5`.

Quick Start
===========
* **Minimum requirements** — You'll need Java 17+ and Spring Boot 3+.

#### Gradle
```kotlin
    implementation("ru.vasiand:spring-boot-starter-log4jdbc:1.0.0")
```

#### Maven
```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>ru.vasiand</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
```
* **Configure** — In `application.properties`, enable a logger (for example, `logging.level.jdbc.sqlonly=INFO`). 
* See [Loggers](#loggers) for details.

Configuration
=============
Use `application.properties` to configure log4jdbc. There is [Spring configuration meta-data](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html) for IDE autocompletion; see [spring-configuration-metadata.json](src/main/resources/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json). Supported settings are:

| log4jdbc.drivers                           |                                                | One or more fully qualified class names for JDBC drivers that log4jdbc should load and wrap. If more than one driver needs to be specified here, they should be comma separated with no spaces. This option is not normally needed because most popular JDBC drivers are already loaded by default. This should be used if one or more additional JDBC drivers that (log4jdbc doesn't already wrap) needs to be included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| log4jdbc.debug.stack.prefix                |                                                | A REGEX matching the package name of your application. The call stack will be searched down to the first occurrence of a class that has the matching REGEX. If this is not set, the actual class that called into log4jdbc is used in the debug output (in many cases this will be a connection pool class). For example, setting a system property such as this: `-Dlog4jdbc.debug.stack.prefix=^com\.mycompany\.myapp.*` would cause the call stack to be searched for the first call that came from code in the com.mycompany.myapp package or below, thus if all of your sql generating code was in code located in the com.mycompany.myapp package or any subpackages, this would be printed in the debug information, rather than the package name for a connection pool, object relational system, etc. Please note that the behavior of this property has changed as compared to the standard log4jdbc implementation. This property is now a REGEX, instead of being just the package prefix of the stack trace. So, for instance, if you want to target the prefix org.mypackage, the value of this property should be: `^org\.mypackage.*.` |
| log4jdbc.sqltiming.warn.threshold          |                                                | Millisecond time value. Causes SQL that takes the number of milliseconds specified or more time to execute to be logged at the warning level in the sqltiming log. Note that the sqltiming log must be enabled at the warn log level for this feature to work. Also the logged output for this setting will log with debug information that is normally only shown when the sqltiming log is enabled at the debug level. This can help you to more quickly find slower running SQL without adding overhead or logging for normal running SQL that executes below the threshold level (if the logging level is set appropriately).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| log4jdbc.spylogdelegator.name              | net.sf.log4jdbc.log.slf4j.Slf4jSpyLogDelegator | The qualified class name of the SpyLogDelegator to use. Note that if you want to use log4jdbc-log4j2 with  Log4j 2 rather than SLF4J, you must set this property to: `net.sf.log4jdbc.log.log4j2.Log4j2SpyLogDelegator`. Note that the default in this Starter is to use SLF4J which is different from the log4jdbc library's default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Loggers
=======
Note that, by default, nothing will be logged. In fact, if all the loggers are disabled (which is the default), then log4jdbc doesn't even wrap the `java.sql.Connection` returned by `javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection()` (which is useful for production configurations).

| logger              | description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| jdbc.sqlonly        | Logs only SQL. SQL executed within a prepared statement is automatically shown with it's bind arguments replaced with the data bound at that position, for greatly increased readability. |
| jdbc.sqltiming      | Logs the SQL, post-execution, including timing statistics on how long the SQL took to execute.                                                                                            |
| jdbc.audit          | Logs ALL JDBC calls except for ResultSets. This is a very voluminous output, and is not normally needed unless tracking down a specific JDBC problem.                                     |
| jdbc.resultset      | Even more voluminous, because all calls to ResultSet objects are logged.                                                                                                                  |
| jdbc.resultsettable | Log the jdbc results as a table. Level debug will fill in unread values in the result set.                                                                                                |
| jdbc.connection     | Logs connection open and close events as well as dumping all open connection numbers. This is very useful for hunting down connection leak problems.                                      |

To set a logger's level, use `application.properties` in the same way any other log level is configured (see the [Spring Boot Logging Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-logging.html) for reference). For example, `logging.level.jdbc.sqlonly=DEBUG`
